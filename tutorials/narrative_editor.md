# M. Narrative Editor

The Polar TEP Narrative Editor enables telling the 'stories' behind the data.

Scientific data can be complex and challenging to communicate. By framing data within narratives, storytelling makes scientific concepts accessible, engaging, and memorable to a wider audience.  It bridges the gap between the technical details of research and the public's understanding, fostering appreciation, curiosity, and ultimately, a deeper connection to the wonders of science.

1\. The Narrative Editor has tools for embedding maps, data, text, pictures, and video into interactive webpages. It uses Markdown, a plain text formatting syntax, to convert plain text into structured HTML documents; it is ‘Markdown with superpowers’. The effect has been termed 'Scrollytelling' –  a blend of the words Scrolling+Storytelling.

Here are some examples:
