# Harshness Indicator


The Harshness Indicator generates maps of the relative harshness of condictions in a region based on wave height, sea ice concentration, and iceberg density data. The user can set the magnitude of each variable that is considered "harsh" and the weight that is given the variable.


1\. Using the "Select Indicator" menu, select the "Harshness Capability".

8\. Since it takes some time for the results to be processed, they are stored for future access. For each stored run there is information on the date of execution and whether the run was successful or failed. There are options to load the results on the map, download the results, or delete the run.
