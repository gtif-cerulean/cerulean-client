# Landslide Risk


The landslide risk capability uses Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques to determine whether the stability of peat bogland is suitable for windfarm development.
The InSAR technique uses Sentinel-1’s Single Look Complex (SLC) product. Millimetre-sized changes can be tracked using InSAR by studying the same area at two different time points. Areas exhibiting larger changes over time are deemed to be at higher risk of landslides.

1\. Using the "Select Indicator" menu, select the "Landslide Risk" capability.

2\. For the demonstration version of the CIF Dashboard, the Landslide Risk capability is restricted to one location in Ireland. Using the two "Select date" boxes choose the dates to be compared for the analysis. Then click on the "Execute" button.

3\. After a period of processing, the results are displayed on the map.

Since it takes some time for the results to be processed, they are stored for future access. For each stored run there is information on the date of execution and whether the run was successful or failed. There are options to load the results on the map, download the results, or delete the run.

4\. Clicking on the question mark icon beside the execution date opens the metadata for the run.

5\. The lefend is shown in the panel on the left.

The bounding box for the analysis is shown in yellow. It can be togglec on and off using the "eye" icon in the legend panel.
