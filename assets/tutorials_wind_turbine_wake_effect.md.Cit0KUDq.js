The consequence of this more turbulent air can be a reduction in wind resource in other windfarms downfield. Depending on the prevailing wind direction, newly constructed offshore wind farms can “steal” the wind resource from existing wind farms. The Wind Turbine Wake Effect algorithm shows the wind and current direction from CMEMS model data overlayed on Sentinel-1 IW GRD SAR data.</p><p>1.
