The CIF demonstration focus region is the North Atlantic and Arctic seas between Canada and Europe. The CIF demonstration provides examples relevant to three topics: Arctic shipping, offshore wind energy, and aquaculture.</p><p>1. Navigate to <a href="https://cif.eox.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://cif.eox.at/</a></p><p>The CIF Home Page provides background information about the Cerulean Information Factory project.

This menu provides access to a wide range of data variables and algorithms that process data to derive information.</p><p>The options can be filtered using a search function or the Theme Filter. In this example, the search term &quot;sea ice&quot; and the theme &quot;Shipping&quot; have been used as a filters to reduce the number of capabilities and data variables offered.</p><p>Next, the &quot;Sea Ice Area Fraction&quot; data variable will be used to illustrate components of the dashboard.</p><p>Click on &quot;Sea Ice Area Fraction&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>4.

The Left Panel shows the Overlay Layers, Data Layers, and Base Layers.</p><p>In this example, the &quot;Wind Energy Areas&quot; of the Overlay Layers has been selected and is visable as the red polygons near Nova Scotia at the bottom centre of the map.</p><p>The Data Layers section of the panel shows the current date selected, the legend for the variable, and the current opacity of the layer. The date and opacity can be manipulated using the slider bars.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>6. The Top Right Panel shows the metadata for the selected data variable or algorithm.</p><p>The information varies by data variable, but typically consists of the variable title, the applicable themes (highlighted under the title), the sensor used, the agency providing the data or algorithm, the frequency of acquistions, the geospatial resolution, the time extent of the data available, a description, and a link or DOI for further information.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>7.
