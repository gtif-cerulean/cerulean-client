### CIF Background

The Cerulean Information Factory (CIF) is a demonstration project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop tools and capabilities that can assist marine industries in supporting a transition to a more sustainable future. CIF is named after the blue-green colour, reflecting the need to combine the Blue and Green Economies in order to have a successful Green Transition.
The CIF project is part of the ESA “Green Transition Information Factories” (GTIF) initiative [https://gtif.esa.int/](https://gtif.esa.int/). The intent is to use Earth Observation (EO) data, geospatial and digital platform technologies, and advanced analytics to generate actionable knowledge and decision support for climate change impact reduction and adaptation.

### CIF Focus

The CIF demonstration focus region is the North Atlantic and Arctic seas between Canada and Europe.

### CIF Tools

This website demonstrates the CIF Dashboard that provides tools for information visualisation and interaction.

However, the CIF Dashboard is just the tip of the iceberg of CIF capabilities. Driving the information in the dashboard is a complete ecosystem of information technologies for:

- Information discovery and interaction
- Programming and processing
- Data storage, management, and access
